Info
====

This is an NDIS driver for Intel Gigabit PCI-Express LAN adapters.
This driver is based on the source code of e1000e Linux kernel module
and of nveth NVIDIA NIC driver for OS/2 developed by nickk.
The driver released under GNU General Public License (GPL). See the
'LICENSE' file for details.

This driver supports the following devices.

82571EB, 82571PT, 82572EI, 82573V, 82573E, 82573L, 82574L, 82583V, 80003ES2LAN,
82562V, 82562G, 82562GT, 82566DM, 82566DC, 82566MC, 82566MM, 82567V-3, 82562V-2,
82562G-2, 82562GT-2, 82566DM-2, 82566DC-2, 82567LM-4, 82567LF, 82567LM, 82567V,
82567LM-2, 82567LF-2, 82567V-2, 82567LM-3, 82567LF-3, 82577LM, 82577LC, 82578DM, 82578D.

More specifically, only the following device IDs are supported. All are Vendor ID 8086.
 1049, 104A, 104B, 104C, 104D, 105E, 105F, 1060, 107D, 107E, 107F, 108B,
 108C, 1096, 1098, 109A, 10A4, 10A5, 10B9, 10BA, 10BB, 10BC, 10BD, 10BF,
 10C0, 10C2, 10C3, 10C4, 10C5, 10CB, 10CC, 10CD, 10CE, 10D3, 10D5, 10D9,
 10DA, 10DE, 10DF, 10E5, 10EA, 10EB, 10EF, 10F0, 10F5, 10F6, 1501, 1502,
 1503, 150C, 294C

Use the PCI.EXE command to find the Vendor ID and Device ID of your hardware.
First check the Vendor ID. If the Vendor ID of your hardare is not 8086, then
your hardware is not supported by this driver. Then check the Device ID. If
the Device ID is not in the list above, then your hardware is not supported
by this driver.  If the Vendor ID of your hardware is 8086, and the Device ID
is listed above, then this driver should work.


Installation
============

You can install the network driver during operating system installation.
Or you can install the driver using the Warpin package.

After you install the files, run mpts.exe and set up the network driver as
usual. Then reboot.

The distribution package also includes a version of the driver in the trace
directory. This version has tracing enabled for debugging purposes. You
would only use the tracing driver if you are debugging a problem in coordination
with the developer. See http://svn.ecomstation.nl/multimac for more information.


Command line options
====================

/An

Selects a specific PCI adapter to use. If not specified, the driver will use the
first unused PCI adapter that is supported by the driver. For example, /A1 will
select the second PCI adapter that is supported by the driver. If the specified
PCI adapter does not exist, the driver will produce an error. /A0 = E1000E$,
/A1 = E1000E2$, /A2 = E1000E3$, etc.

/Q

Turns off the version banner when the driver loads.


Options only in the trace build
-------------------------------

/Tn

Sets the minor trace number for controlling trace output. Only applies
to the trace build of the driver. Ignored in the retail version.


Options only in the debug build
-------------------------------

The debug build is not included in the distribution package and is only
for developer use.

/Dn

Sets the debug output level to n. The default is 5. Only applies
to the debug build of the driver. Ignored in the retail version.

/COM=n

Sets the serial port for debug output. Valid values are 1 and 2
for COM1 and COM2, or the port address. The default is no serial
port output. Only applies to the debug build of the driver.
Ignored in the retail version.


PROTOCOL.INI Options
====================

There are the following switches you can tune the driver work:

MODE

Intel Gigabit PCIe network adapters support the following operation modes

    10HALF    -  half duplex operation at 10 Mb/s
    10FULL    -  full duplex operation at 10 Mb/s
    100HALF   -  half duplex operation at 100 Mb/s
    100FULL   -  full duplex operation at 100 Mb/s
    1000FULL  -  full duplex operation at 1000 Mb/s

The default mode is Auto-Negotiation.

RXCHAIN

The way of transferring received packets to the protocol drivers: receive
chain and lookahead. The recommended setting is the receive chain.

NETADDRESS

Specifies the MAC address to use instead of the vendor supplied unique
address. Must be exactly 12 hex digits long.
Example: NETADDRESS = "4061865F3888"
