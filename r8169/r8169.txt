Realtek Gigabit PCIe NIC Driver for OS/2
Copyright (C) 2014 David Azarewicz


Info
====

This is an NDIS driver for Realtek Gigabit PCI-Express LAN adapters.
This driver is based on the source code of r8169 Linux kernel module.

This driver supports the following devices.

    RTL8169, RTL8169s, RTL8110s, RTL8169sb/8110sb,
    RTL8169sc/8110sc RTL8102e, RTL8101e, RTL8168b/8111b,
    RTL8100e, RTL8168cp/8111cp, RTL8168c/8111c, RTL8168d/8111d,
    RTL8168dp/8111dp, RTL8105e, RTL8168e/8111e, RTL8168evl/8111evl,
    RTL8168f/8111f, RTL8402, RTL8411, RTL8106e, RTL8168g/8111g

These correspond to the following Vendor:Device numbers:

    10EC:8129, 10EC:8136, 10EC:8167, 10EC:8168, 10EC:8169,
    1186:4300, 1186:4302, 1259:C107, 16EC:0116,
    and certain subsets of 1737:1032 and 0001:8168)

Use the PCI.EXE command to find the Vendor ID and Device ID of your
hardware. If the Vendor ID and the Device ID is listed above, then this
driver should work.


License
=======

The binary distribution of this driver is licensed for use on eComStation
version 1.2 or higher.


Installation
============

You can install the network driver during operating system installation.
Or you can install the driver using the Warpin package.

After you install the files, run mpts.exe and set up the network driver as
usual. Then reboot.

The distribution package also includes a version of the driver in the trace
directory. This version has tracing enabled for debugging purposes. You
would only use the tracing driver if you are debugging a problem in coordination
with the developer. See http://svn.ecomstation.nl/multimac for more information.

If your hardware requires a firmware file and you re-install the same or an
updated WPI package when the driver is loaded, you will get an error that the
installer cannot overwrite the firmware file. You can safely skip updating
this file since the firmware typically does not change.


Command line options
====================

/An

Selects a specific PCI adapter to use. If not specified, the driver will use the
first unused PCI adapter that is supported by the driver. For example, /A1 will
select the second PCI adapter that is supported by the driver. If the specified
PCI adapter does not exist, the driver will produce an error. /A0 = R8169$,
/A1 = R81692$, /A2 = R81693$, etc.

/V

Turns on the version banner when the driver loads.

/Fdirectory

Specifies the location of the rtl_nic directory that contains the firmware files.
The default \IBMCOM.


Options only in the trace build
-------------------------------

/Tn

Sets the minor trace number for controlling trace output. Only applies
to the trace build of the driver. Ignored in the retail version.


Options only in the debug build
-------------------------------

The debug build is not included in the distribution package and is only
for developer use.

/Dn

Sets the debug output level to n. The default is 5. Only applies
to the debug build of the driver. Ignored in the retail version.

/On

Sets the serial port for debug output. Valid values are 1 and 2
for COM1 and COM2. The default is no serial port output. Only
applies to the debug build of the driver. Ignored in the retail
version.


PROTOCOL.INI Options
====================

There are the following switches you can tune the driver work:

MODE

Intel Gigabit PCIe network adapters support the following operation modes

    10HALF    -  half duplex operation at 10 Mb/s
    10FULL    -  full duplex operation at 10 Mb/s
    100HALF   -  half duplex operation at 100 Mb/s
    100FULL   -  full duplex operation at 100 Mb/s
    1000FULL  -  full duplex operation at 1000 Mb/s

The default mode is Auto-Negotiation.

RXCHAIN

The way of transferring received packets to the protocol drivers: receive
chain and lookahead. The recommended setting is the receive chain which is
the default.

NETADDRESS

Specifies the MAC address to use instead of the vendor supplied unique
address. Must be exactly 12 hex digits long.
Example: NETADDRESS = "4061865F3888"
